## Introduction

Self-attention is the **heart of Transformers** and the foundational block of modern AI models like:
- **BERT** - Bidirectional Encoder Representations
- **GPT** - Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- **ChatGPT** - Advanced conversational AI

Self-attention is what makes Transformers so powerful and revolutionary. In this tutorial, we'll build self-attention **from scratch**, step by step, understanding why each component is needed.

## The Problem: Contextual Word Representation

### The Core Challenge

In English (and most languages), **the same word can mean different things in different contexts**.

#### Example 1: The word "light"

| Sentence | Meaning | Context |
|----------|---------|---------|
| "**Light**" | Electromagnetic radiation visible to humans | Physics/General |
| "**Light**weight" | Something with less weight | Measure of mass |
| "**Light** blue" | A lighter shade of blue | Color |
| "**Light**er candle" | To ignite (verb) | Action |
| "**Light**-headed" | Dizzy, faint | Medical/Feeling |

#### Example 2: The word "Apple"

| Sentence | Meaning | Context |
|----------|---------|---------|
| "I love **Apple** phones" | Technology company | Tech/Business |
| "I love **apple** juice" | Fruit | Food/Nature |

### Why This Matters

We need **different representations** of the same word based on its context. The word "Apple" should have:
- High values for [Tech, Electronics, Smart] when used with "phones"
- High values for [Fruit, Food, Natural] when used with "juice"

**This is the problem RNN-based models could not solve.**

---

## Understanding Word Embeddings Limitations

### What are Word Embeddings?

Word embeddings are **fixed numerical vectors** that represent words. Each dimension corresponds to certain features.

**Example: Word embedding for "Apple"**
```
Apple = [0.5,          0.8,          0.3,          0.9,          0.2, ...,          0.6]
         ↑              ↑             ↑             ↑             ↑                  ↑
         Tech           Fruit        Food          Smart         Natural  ...,      Sweet
```

### The Static Problem

Consider these two sentences:
1. "I love Apple phones"
2. "I love apple juice"

**With traditional word embeddings:**
```
Apple embedding = 50% Tech properties + 50% Fruit properties
```

**The Problem:**
- Same embedding used in BOTH sentences
- Cannot effectively represent the specific meaning in each context
- No way to distinguish between Apple (company) and apple (fruit)

### What We Need

**Dynamic embeddings** that adapt to context:

```
Sentence 1: "I love Apple phones"
Apple embedding → 90% Tech + 10% Fruit ✓

Sentence 2: "I love apple juice"  
Apple embedding → 10% Tech + 90% Fruit ✓
```

**Self-attention gives us this power!**

---

## Building Self-Attention from Scratch

Let's build self-attention step by step, solving problems as we encounter them.

### Step 1: Representing Words with Context

**Key Insight:** The meaning of a word is determined by the other words in the sentence.

If we want to create a new representation for "Apple", we should consider ALL other words in the sentence.

**Sentence:** "I love Apple phones"

**New representation of Apple:**
```
Apple' = 0.1 × love + 0.5 × Apple + 0.4 × phones
```

**What does this mean?**
- New Apple = 10% embeddings of "love"
- New Apple = 50% embeddings of "Apple" (itself)
- New Apple = 40% embeddings of "phones"

**Result:**
- We're taking the original "Apple" embedding
- Adding 40% of "phones" embeddings to it
- Since "phones" has tech properties, overall embedding shifts toward technology
- Original: 50% Tech, 50% Fruit
- After: ~70% Tech, 30% Fruit ✓

### Step 2: Applying to Different Contexts

**Sentence:** "I love apple juice"

**New representation of apple:**
```
apple' = 0.1 × love + 0.5 × apple + 0.4 × juice
```

**Result:**
- Adding 40% of "juice" embeddings
- "juice" has fruit/beverage properties
- Overall embedding shifts toward fruit
- Original: 50% Tech, 50% Fruit
- After: ~30% Tech, 70% Fruit ✓

### Step 3: Representations for All Words

We need to create new representations for **every word**, not just "Apple".

**For "love apple phones":**
```
love' = 0.8 × love + 0.1 × Apple + 0.1 × phones
```

**For "love apple juice":**
```
juice' = 0.1 × love + 0.4 × apple + 0.5 × juice
```

Notice: Adding some "apple" properties to "juice" makes it more specifically "apple juice"!

## Calculating the Numbers: Similarity Scores

### The Question

**Where do these numbers (0.1, 0.5, 0.4) come from?**

These numbers represent the **relationship** or **similarity** between words:
- 0.4 = How much is "Apple" related to "phones"?
- 0.5 = How much is "Apple" related to "Apple" (itself)?
- 0.1 = How much is "Apple" related to "love"?

### Similarity Through Distance

In word embedding space, words are positioned based on their meaning:
<img width="714" height="416" alt="similarity_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a04c7ceb-8a5b-49bf-a69a-725d311b08c4" />

**Key principle of word embeddings:**
- **Closer words** = More related/similar
- **Farther words** = Less related/dissimilar

### Dot Product Similarity

**Mathematical formula for similarity:**

For two vectors A and B:
```
Similarity(A, B) = A · B (dot product)
```

**Example calculations:**

**Similarity(Apple, phones):**
```
Apple = (2, 2)
phones = (2, 2)

Similarity = (2 × 2) + (2 × 2) = 4 + 4 = 8
```

**Similarity(Apple, love):**
```
Apple = (2, 2)
love = (-4, 3)

Similarity = (2 × -4) + (2 × 3) = -8 + 6 = -2
```

**Similarity(Apple, juice):**
```
Apple = (2, 2)
juice = (4, 0)

Similarity = (2 × 4) + (2 × 0) = 8 + 0 = 8
```

**Similarity(Apple, Apple):**
```
Similarity = (2 × 2) + (2 × 2) = 4 + 4 = 8
```

### Converting to Probabilities with Softmax

**Problem:** Our similarity scores are: -2, 8, 8
- Can be negative
- Can be very large
- Don't sum to 1

**Solution:** Use **Softmax** function!

```
Input:  [-2, 8, 8]
              ↓
         Softmax
              ↓
Output: [0.0, 0.5, 0.5] ✓

Sum = 1.0 ✓
All positive ✓
```
<img width="962" height="339" alt="softmax" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9db07fad-e38e-4e50-925f-d8862ee73672" />


### Complete Process

**To find new representation of "Apple":**

1. **Calculate similarities** (dot products):
   ```
   sim(Apple, love)   = E(Apple) · E(love)   = -2
   sim(Apple, Apple)  = E(Apple) · E(Apple)  = 8
   sim(Apple, phones) = E(Apple) · E(phones) = 8
   ```

2. **Apply Softmax:**
   ```
   [-2, 8, 8] → Softmax → [x₁, x₂, x₃] = [0.0, 0.5, 0.5]
   ```

3. **Multiply with embeddings and sum:**
   ```
   Apple' = x₁ × E(love) + x₂ × E(Apple) + x₃ × E(phones)
          = 0.0 × E(love) + 0.5 × E(Apple) + 0.5 × E(phones)
   ```

**This is the foundation of self-attention!**

## Adding Learnable Parameters

### Problem 1: No Trainable Parameters

**Current issue:**
- All calculations use only word embeddings
- No learnable parameters
- Cannot adapt to specific tasks
- Model cannot learn which similarities are relevant

**Example problem:**

Consider a chatbot for an electronics store:
- Customer says: "I love Apple watch"
- Word "watch" can mean:
  - "See/observe" (verb)
  - "Clock/timepiece" (noun)
- "Apple" lies between fruit and tech
- Without training, model won't recognize "Apple watch" as a smartwatch
- It might see "Apple" and "watch" as separate, unrelated entities

**What we need:**
- Learnable parameters to capture task-specific similarities
- Ability to train the model to understand: "Apple" + "watch" = Apple smartwatch
- Parameters that amplify relevant similarities and suppress irrelevant ones

### Problem 2: Same Vector Used Everywhere

**Current issue:**

We use the same embedding vector in three places:
1. Horizontal vectors (for similarity calculation)
2. Vertical vectors (for similarity calculation)
3. Final multiplication vectors (after softmax)

**Result:**
```
Similarity(Apple, phones) = Similarity(phones, Apple)
```

Both words pull each other equally, like gravity. This means:
- If Apple shifts toward phones
- Then phones also shifts toward Apple

**But we might want:**
- Apple shifts toward phones ✓
- Phones stays where it is ✓

### Solution: Introduce Weight Matrices

**Three different weight matrices:**
- **W_Q** (Query weights)
- **W_K** (Key weights)
- **W_V** (Value weights)

**Apply different transformations:**
```
Horizontal vectors: multiply with W_Q
Vertical vectors:   multiply with W_K
Final vectors:      multiply with W_V
```

Now similarity becomes:
```
Similarity(Apple, phones) = (A × E_Apple) · (B × E_phones)
Similarity(phones, Apple) = (A × E_phones) · (B × E_Apple)

These are NOT equal! ✓
```

**Benefits:**
1. Learnable parameters that adapt during training
2. Different similarities in different directions
3. Model learns which relationships matter for the task
4. Avoids symmetric similarity problem

---

## Query, Key, and Value Matrices

### The Three Transformations

From each word embedding, we create **three different vectors**:

```
E(Apple) → multiply by W_Q → Q(Apple)  [Query]
E(Apple) → multiply by W_K → K(Apple)  [Key]
E(Apple) → multiply by W_V → V(Apple)  [Value]
```

### Dimensions

**From the "Attention is All You Need" paper:**

```
Word embedding dimension:     512
Weight matrix dimensions:     512 × 64
Resulting Q, K, V dimensions: 64

Example:
E(Apple): [1 × 512]
W_Q:      [512 × 64]
Q(Apple): [1 × 64] ✓
```

### The Naming Intuition

**Query (Q):** "What am I looking for?"
- The word asking: "Which other words are relevant to me?"

**Key (K):** "What do I offer?"
- Other words saying: "Here's what I represent"

**Value (V):** "What information do I contribute?"
- The actual content each word contributes

**Analogy:** Like a database lookup
- Query: Your search term
- Key: Index to find relevant items
- Value: The actual data retrieved

---

## Mathematical Formulation

### Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's calculate the new representation for "Apple" in: "I love Apple phones"

#### Step 1: Generate Q, K, V vectors

```
Q(Apple) = E(Apple) × W_Q    [1×512] × [512×64] = [1×64]
K(Apple) = E(Apple) × W_K    [1×512] × [512×64] = [1×64]
V(Apple) = E(Apple) × W_V    [1×512] × [512×64] = [1×64]

Similarly for love, phones:
Q(love), K(love), V(love)
Q(phones), K(phones), V(phones)
```

#### Step 2: Calculate Similarities (Attention Scores)

To find new representation of "Apple", calculate similarities between:
- Q(Apple) and K(love)
- Q(Apple) and K(Apple)
- Q(Apple) and K(phones)

```
score₁ = Q(Apple) · K(love)ᵀ     [1×64] × [64×1] = scalar
score₂ = Q(Apple) · K(Apple)ᵀ    [1×64] × [64×1] = scalar
score₃ = Q(Apple) · K(phones)ᵀ   [1×64] × [64×1] = scalar

Result: [score₁, score₂, score₃]
```

**Note:** Q(Apple) remains the same; K vectors change for different words.

#### Step 3: Apply Softmax

```
[score₁, score₂, score₃]
         ↓
     Softmax
         ↓
[x₁, x₂, x₃]  where x₁ + x₂ + x₃ = 1
```

These are now **attention weights** (probabilities).

#### Step 4: Weighted Sum with Value Vectors

```
Apple' = x₁ × V(love) + x₂ × V(Apple) + x₃ × V(phones)
```

Where:
- x₁ = probabilistic similarity between Apple and love
- x₂ = probabilistic similarity between Apple and Apple
- x₃ = probabilistic similarity between Apple and phones

**This is the new contextual representation of "Apple"!**

### For All Words

Repeat the same process for every word:

**For "love":**
```
Use Q(love) with all K vectors
Apply softmax
Multiply with V vectors
Get love'
```

**For "phones":**
```
Use Q(phones) with all K vectors
Apply softmax
Multiply with V vectors
Get phones'
```

**Key difference:** Only the Q vector changes; everything else stays the same!

## Complete Example Walkthrough

### Sentence: "I love Apple phones"

Let's see the complete calculation with actual matrices.

#### Initial Setup

**Word embeddings matrix:**
```
E = [E(love)  ]  = [1×512]     3 words
    [E(Apple) ]    [1×512]  →  × 
    [E(phones)]    [1×512]     512 dimensions

Matrix E: [3 × 512]
```

#### Step 1: Create Q, K, V Matrices

```
Weight matrices (from paper):
W_Q: [512 × 64]
W_K: [512 × 64]
W_V: [512 × 64]

Calculate:
Q = E × W_Q = [3×512] × [512×64] = [3×64]
K = E × W_K = [3×512] × [512×64] = [3×64]
V = E × W_V = [3×512] × [512×64] = [3×64]

Q = [Q(love)  ]     K = [K(love)  ]     V = [V(love)  ]
    [Q(Apple) ]         [K(Apple) ]         [V(Apple) ]
    [Q(phones)]         [K(phones)]         [V(phones)]
```

#### Step 2: Calculate Attention Scores

```
Scores = Q × Kᵀ = [3×64] × [64×3] = [3×3]

           K(love) K(Apple) K(phones)
         ┌─────────────────────────┐
Q(love)  │ s₁₁     s₁₂      s₁₃   │
Q(Apple) │ s₂₁     s₂₂      s₂₃   │
Q(phones)│ s₃₁     s₃₂      s₃₃   │
         └─────────────────────────┘

Where:
s₁₁ = similarity between love and love
s₁₂ = similarity between love and Apple
s₁₃ = similarity between love and phones
s₂₁ = similarity between Apple and love
s₂₂ = similarity between Apple and Apple
s₂₃ = similarity between Apple and phones
... and so on
```

#### Step 3: Apply Softmax (Row-wise)

```
Apply softmax to EACH ROW:

Scores → Softmax(Scores) = Attention_Weights [3×3]

        love   Apple  phones
      ┌──────────────────────┐
love  │ x₁₁    x₁₂    x₁₃   │  ← sum = 1
Apple │ x₂₁    x₂₂    x₂₃   │  ← sum = 1
phones│ x₃₁    x₃₂    x₃₃   │  ← sum = 1
      └──────────────────────┘

Each row now contains probabilities that sum to 1.
```

#### Step 4: Multiply with Values

```
Output = Attention_Weights × V = [3×3] × [3×64] = [3×64]

       = [love'  ]    [1×64]
         [Apple' ]    [1×64]
         [phones']    [1×64]

Where:
love'   = x₁₁×V(love) + x₁₂×V(Apple) + x₁₃×V(phones)
Apple'  = x₂₁×V(love) + x₂₂×V(Apple) + x₂₃×V(phones)
phones' = x₃₁×V(love) + x₃₂×V(Apple) + x₃₃×V(phones)
```

### The Complete Formula

**Self-Attention equation from "Attention is All You Need":**

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q × Kᵀ / √d_k) × V
```

Where:
- Q: Query matrix [n × d_k]
- K: Key matrix [n × d_k]
- V: Value matrix [n × d_v]
- d_k: Dimension of key vectors (64 in our example)
- √d_k: Scaling factor (explained in advanced topics)
- n: Number of words in the sentence

**Note:** We'll cover the division by √d_k in advanced tutorials.

## Advantages of Self-Attention

### 1. Parallel Processing 🚀

**RNN (Sequential):**
```
Process word₁ → wait → Process word₂ → wait → Process word₃
Time: O(n) where n = sequence length
```

**Self-Attention (Parallel):**
```
Process [word₁, word₂, word₃] simultaneously
Time: O(1) regardless of sequence length
```

**Benefits:**
- All word representations calculated at the same time
- Can use multiple GPUs effectively
- 1000 words take same time as 1 word!
- Training is extremely fast

**Example with 3 words:**

```
┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
│ Calculate   │   │ Calculate   │   │ Calculate   │
│   love'     │   │   Apple'    │   │   phones'   │
│             │   │             │   │             │
│ Uses Q(love)│   │Uses Q(Apple)│   │Uses Q(phones)│
│ All K, V    │   │ All K, V    │   │ All K, V    │
└─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘
       ↓                 ↓                 ↓
    PARALLEL         PARALLEL         PARALLEL
       ↓                 ↓                 ↓
   Thread 1          Thread 2          Thread 3
```

All three calculations are **completely independent**!

### 2. Long-Range Dependencies ✓

**RNN Problem:**
```
[word₁] → [word₂] → ... → [word₅₀]
   ↓                          ↓
Information here       Information here
gradually fades        is strongest
```

**Self-Attention Solution:**
```
Every word directly connected to every other word
No matter how far apart they are!

word₁ ←─────────────────────────→ word₅₀
  ✓ Direct connection
  ✓ No information loss
  ✓ Captures relationships across entire sentence
```

**Example:**

Sentence: "The company Apple, which was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in a garage, released revolutionary products like iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers that changed the technology industry forever, and today continues to innovate with features like Siri, FaceID, Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple Music streaming service."

To understand "Apple Music":
- RNN: Struggles to remember "Apple" from the beginning
- Self-Attention: Directly connects "Apple" with "Music" ✓

### 3. Contextual Understanding 🎯

**Self-attention analyzes relationships like gravity:**

```
Before self-attention:
    
    phones (tech)
         ●
        
    
    Apple (50% tech, 50% fruit)
         ●
    
    
    juice (beverage)
         ●
```

**Strong attraction between related words:**

```
Sentence 1: "Apple phones"

Apple ←──────(strong pull)──────→ phones
  ●                                  ●
   \                                /
    ─→ Both shift toward "tech" ←─

Result: Apple' is now 90% tech ✓
```

```
Sentence 2: "apple juice"

apple ←──────(strong pull)──────→ juice
  ●                                  ●
   \                                /
    ─→ Both shift toward "fruit" ←─

Result: apple' is now 90% fruit ✓
```

### 4. Flexibility and Scalability

**Can handle any sequence length:**
- 10 words ✓
- 100 words ✓
- 1000 words ✓
- Even longer ✓

**Scales to massive datasets:**
- Billions of words
- Multiple languages
- Diverse contexts

---

## What's Next?

In upcoming tutorials, we will cover:

1. **Multi-Head Attention**
   - Multiple attention mechanisms in parallel
   - Capturing different types of relationships

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Conceptual Understanding
Given the sentence "The bank by the river has steep slopes":
- What does "bank" mean here?
- How would self-attention help disambiguate?
- Which words would have high attention weights with "bank"?

### Exercise 2: Manual Calculation
Given 2D embeddings:
```
cat = [1, 2]
sat = [3, 1]
mat = [2, 3]
```
Calculate:
1. Similarity scores (dot products)
2. Softmax probabilities for "cat"
3. New representation of "cat"

### Exercise 3: Matrix Dimensions
If we have:
- Sentence length: 20 words
- Embedding dimension: 512
- Q, K, V dimension: 64

Calculate dimensions for:
1. E matrix
2. Q, K, V matrices
3. Attention scores matrix
4. Output matrix

## Notes Section

### Key Formulas to Remember

```
1. Attention Scores:
   Scores = Q × Kᵀ

2. Attention Weights:
   Weights = softmax(Scores)

3. Output:
   Output = Weights × V

4. Complete Self-Attention:
   Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q × Kᵀ) × V
```
